# Group Project Repository

Welcome!

We have added to this repository a `README.md`, `.gitignore`, and `.gitattributes`.

- **README.md**: is the document you are currently reading. It should be replaced with information about your project, and instructions on how to use your code in someone else's local computer.

- **.gitignore**: lets you filter out files that should not be added to git. For example, Windows 10 and Mac OS create hidden system files (e.g., .DS_Store) that are local to your computer and should not be part of the repository. This files should be filtered by the `.gitignore` file. This initial `.gitignore` has been created to filter local files when using MacOS and Node. Depending on your project make sure you update the `.gitignore` file. More information about this can be found in this [link](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore).

- **.gitattributes**: configures the line ending of files, to ensure consistency across development environments. More information can be found in this [link](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes).

Remember that _"this document"_ can use `different formats` to **highlight** important information. This is just an example of different formating tools available for you. For help with the format you can find a guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github).

## General info

This is project is to build a web app which server for vending car's owner and customer. By developing the fron end for displaying and back end for storing the vendor's and customer's and snacks' information, we could easily extract and accept the request made by customer and owner (for example, for customer to order snacks from the provided menu list and for owner to receive the customer's order's information to prepare the meal). All the images are found in unsplash.com by copying the image url address and store for each snacks. All information of snacks are pre-set and store in mongoDB collection "snacks". Similarlly, the vnedor's information are pre-set and store in mongoDB as all the van owner are pre-listed by the developer in this project's requirement.
